# Discord-Bot
My Python code for the Discord bot that I created. Aimed to converse and automatically greet user under certain triggers. Still under development.
Bot allows user to add encouraging motivations and detect any signs of distress in user's message to send inspirational quotes from an API.
Code will contain some concepts from asyncio programs and api requests as well as json file manipulation.
Using database in Replit to store encouragements.
